# Pending Changes

## 2026-05-28 - Paper tree stage sprite crop fix

### Summary

- Fixed paper tree stage sprites that contained two vertically separated sprite fragments in one PNG.
- Cropped the `sapling`, `tree`, and `flower` stage assets for all six paper tree varieties to keep only the first valid sprite segment.
- Confirmed `paper-ginkgo-tree.png` now contains a single tree instead of a split tree plus leftover lower fragment.

### Files Changed

- `assets/sprites/stages/paper-*-sapling.png`
- `assets/sprites/stages/paper-*-tree.png`
- `assets/sprites/stages/paper-*-flower.png`

### Verification

- Re-scanned alpha row segments for all updated PNGs; each file now reports one continuous segment.
- Visually inspected `assets/sprites/stages/paper-ginkgo-tree.png`.

### Notes

- This fixes the card/detail split-tree artifact shown when rendering the broken stage asset.
- Existing concurrent edits in `src/app.js` and `styles.css` were not modified as part of this asset fix.

## 2026-05-28 - Major garden art refresh rollup

### Summary

- Consolidates the currently unpushed local work into one larger visual update candidate.
- Adds project working requirements in `AGENTS.md` so future parallel Codex work records completed local slices before a combined push.
- Keeps the plant card, overview garden, and detail dialog aligned around the shared `garden-background-v2.png` bitmap direction.
- Reuses stage sprites in both compact cards and detail dialogs, with corrected seed/sapling and sowing/growing display sizes.
- Moves plant labels and sprite anchors into safer positions so tall pixel assets do not overlap important text.

### Unpushed Local Scope

- Modified: `index.html`
- Modified: `src/app.js`
- Modified: `styles.css`
- Added: `AGENTS.md`
- Added: `docs/pending-changes.md`

### Verification

- Reviewed `docs/pending-changes.md` against `git status --short --branch`.
- Reviewed the working tree diff for `index.html`, `src/app.js`, and `styles.css`.
- Ran `git diff --check`; only Git line-ending warnings appeared for existing files, with no whitespace errors.

### Notes

- No commits are ahead of `origin/main`; the remaining unpushed work is currently in the local working tree.
- No new image assets were generated in this rollup.
- Existing tracked art assets and `docs/art-progress.md` were left untouched.

## Standing Workflow Note

- Project working requirements are now documented in `AGENTS.md`.
- For parallel Codex work, record each completed local fix or feature slice here before a combined review and push.
- For generated art assets, also record the asset purpose, generated files, prompt/style constraints, and integration notes here.

## 2026-05-28 - Plant sprite alignment and sizing

### Summary

- Fixed overview garden plant sprites using a centered ground-anchor layout.
- Adjusted seed/sapling and sowing/growing sprite display boxes so tall pixel assets keep their intended proportions.
- Moved overview plant labels below the sprite instead of overlapping the tree canopy or trunk.
- Matched card and detail scene sapling/growing sprite proportions with the actual tall source assets.
- Follow-up: reapplied the overview map portion after confirming the committed refresh still had the old `112px` square sprite box and negative label margin.

### Files Changed

- `styles.css`

### Verification

- Confirmed the local server returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`.
- Ran `git diff --check`; only line-ending warnings appeared for existing files, with no whitespace errors.

### Notes

- This change is intentionally left unpushed so it can be included with the other in-progress work.
- Existing unrelated edits in `index.html`, `src/app.js`, and empty-plot assets were not modified as part of this fix.

## 2026-05-28 - Detail scene visual style unification

### Summary

- Replaced the rough CSS-drawn card scene background with the shared `garden-background-v2.png` art direction.
- Added a matching bitmap scene to the tree and flower detail dialog.
- Reused existing stage sprites for both card and detail scenes, instead of drawing the plant body with CSS.

### Files Changed

- `index.html`
- `src/app.js`
- `styles.css`

### Verification

- Ran a local Playwright check through Microsoft Edge at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`.
- Created QA tree and flower entries, opened both detail dialogs, and confirmed the shared garden background and stage sprites loaded.
- Confirmed no relevant console warnings or errors were emitted during that check.

### Notes

- No new visual assets were generated for this slice.
- Existing empty-plot assets, `AGENTS.md`, and unrelated `docs/art-progress.md` edits were left untouched.
